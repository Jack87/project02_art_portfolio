## Features

Art Portfolio is an app that utilizes a simple interface for viewing or displaying art. On the consumer side, there is an interactive carousel that allows for viewing 5 of the top works from the artist. Moving to the portfolio pages allows all of the artist's work to be viewed. A commission's page is available that allows the consumer to enter their name, telephone, email, an image that is similar to the work they are asking for, and a brief description of the commission. Finally, the consumer is able to send a comunique to the artist for situations outside of a commission.

The artist has a few options available to them as well. By entering the "Account management" section, the artist is able to upload new artwork, delete existing artwork, or edit the data associated with any of the artworks in the database. Future design includes:

1. View commissions submitted by consumers
2. Edit artist bio

## Installation

Perform either a clone or a fork by visiting [Project 2 Art Portfolio](https://github.com/Jack87/project02_art_portfolio).

The user then needs to install the appropriate npm files, which are included in the package.json as dependencies. Perform an npm install, and you are ready!

## How to Use

The simplest way to use this app is just to visit the heroku-hosted [Art Portfolio on Heroku](https://thawing-ravine-93395.herokuapp.com/), and enjoy. The user is able to view the carousel, click the down arrow and see information about the artist, or head over to the navbar. From there, the user can navigate to the portfolio, setup a commission, contact the artist, or view the artist's other social media. The website is easily navigated by even new users, and allows users to quickly gather the information they need on an artist.

The artist has an administrative panel that gives them a lot of control over the website's content. Furthermore, they can edit their bio, or view their open commissions.
